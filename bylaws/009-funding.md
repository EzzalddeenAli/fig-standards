# Funding

## Scope and objectives

PHP-FIG is, as it often happens in Open Source communities, an organization composed by volunteers only; this doesn't exclude the fact that the organization itself may have some costs to sustain itself, for example maintaining tools such as a site and an email account. For such and similar reasons, we need a way to raise and govern money inside our organization.

This document defines the roles, rules and processes that must be followed inside the PHP-FIG in all matters regarding money, to guarantee fairness, transparency and impartiality. This document intentionally describes the only allowed processes and ways to raise, administer and spend money, so that any change to such processes or any variation in budget allocation requires a bylaw change vote. 

## Fiscal hosting

For handling money and fiscal matters, the PHP-FIG will use [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/) as a fiscal host.
All three Secretaries, but only the Secretaries, will have full administrative access to PHP-FIG's OpenCollective account.  They do not have discretionary authority, however, except as stated explicitly in this bylaw.

All monetary contributions will flow through OpenCollective, so that any tax considerations will be handled automatically, and every financial decision will be published and publicly available through OpenCollective's budgetary tools.

# Raising money

PHP-FIG accepts donations through multiple channels.  Only the Secretaries may actively solicit donations from any party.  No other PHP-FIG member may do so.

### Through OpenCollective

Direct contributions will be accepted through OpenCollective.

### Through TideLift

Contributions will be accepted through [TideLift](https://tidelift.com/).  They will pay out to the OpenCollective account.

### Through Thanks.dev

Contributions will be accepted through [Thanks.dev](https://thanks.dev).  They will pay out to the OpenCollective account.

## Spending money

Funds donated to the PHP-FIG are to be used for non-personnel operating expenses.  PHP-FIG does not pay individual contributors to PHP-FIG standards or working groups.
All operating or capital expenses must be approved by an Approval Vote of the Core Committee.  The expense must include whether it is one time or recurring and at which frequency.  All expenses must be justified by their contribution to the mission of PHP-FIG.

Expenses approved by the Core Committee will be listed below.

### Overfunding, and giving back to the community

PHP-FIG will maintain financial reserves to account for three years of the currently approved budget.
At least once a year, any surplus funds will be forwarded to the [PHP Foundation](https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation) as a way to further support the PHP ecosystem.

### Approved expenses

This section will contain a chronological list of approved budgeting decisions, either recurring or not.

As an exception to Votes Bylaw, changes to this section only will not trigger a Bylaw Change Vote, but only an Approval Vote by the Core Committee, as explained in the "Spending Money" section.
